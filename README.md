### Making sure everyone is heard

- Retrospectives and Stand-ups: we go around in a rota until everyone has had their say.

### Facilitating Brainstorming

- Miro board: Everyone writes a few ideas down on a post-it note. Completely anonymous. No silly ideas.
- Can split off individually and each person presents their idea at the end of alloted time.
